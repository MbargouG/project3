        <h2>About Me &#x2d; section By Bianca Suchite</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
          The beauty of a photograph lies within the story it silently tells,
  demanding attention and admiration from those who choose to listen. Each of
  Chicago based photographer, Mbargou Gueye’s, photos holds a complex story
  different than the last. His photographs immediately intrigue and provoke
  thought from its viewers. Claiming the world as his studio, Gueye creates art
  within whichever environment he chooses. Through the deliberate and strategic
  manipulation of color and contrast, Gueye pushes artistic boundaries through
his
  photography, capturing raw emotion and making profound statements. At 27 years
  old, his artistry is still unfolding and evolving as he looks to continue to
  grow his platform and craft.
          </p>
          <p>
          As with many beautiful things in this life, Gueye did not seek
  photography; instead photography found him. Initially purchasing a camera to
  document the fitness journey he underwent in 2016, Gueye soon realized both
the
  power of the camera and his own artistic capabilities and chose to pursue
  photography professionally. Since then, his interest in the craft has
blossomed
  and become his passion. His presence on social media has allowed Gueye the
  opportunity to establish his public platform and widen his reach, also
allowing
  him to draw inspiration from the creative communities he comes across
digitally.
  Gueye has every intention of continuing to improve his career, and intends on
  seizing such endeavor in 2019 through shooting more videos, hosting gallery
  events and pushing his clothing brand, ‘G U EYE’. As his career and artistic
  ability continues to elevate, Gueye’s photographs continue to speak volumes to
  the world.
